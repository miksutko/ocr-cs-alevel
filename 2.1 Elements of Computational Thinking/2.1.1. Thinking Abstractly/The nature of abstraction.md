Abstraction is a foundational principle in Computer Science and a critical part of computational thinking. It involves simplifying problems by removing unnecessary details, leaving only the essential features.

# Types of Abstraction

## 1. Representational Abstraction
- Focuses on simplifying a problem by identifying and retaining only the relevant details.
- Removes excessive details to create a clear representation of the problem.
## 2. Abstraction by Generalisation
- Groups together similar aspects of a problem to determine its type.
- Enables categorisation of problems, allowing for the reuse of common solutions.

# Data Abstraction
- Hides the details of how data is stored or implemented.
- Allows the use of **abstract data structures** (e.g., stacks, queues) without needing knowledge of their underlying implementations.
## Examples:
- **Stack Operations**:
    - **Push** and **pop** items to/from a stack without worrying about how the stack is implemented.
---
# Procedural Abstraction
- Focuses on **what a subroutine does**, not **how it does it**.
- Often used in **decomposition**, breaking problems into smaller, manageable parts.
- Subroutines are treated as **black boxes**, allowing for:
    - Reusability.
    - Simplified debugging and testing.

# Multiple Levels of Abstraction
Large, complex systems employ multiple levels of abstraction, each performing distinct roles:
1. **High Levels of Abstraction**:
    - Closest to the user.
    - Provide interfaces for user interaction with hardware.
2. **Low Levels of Abstraction**:
    - Closest to the hardware.
    - Execute machine code to perform tasks.

# Key Takeaways
- Abstraction simplifies problem-solving by focusing on essential features.
- Different types of abstraction serve distinct purposes, from data handling to system-level organisation.
- Multiple abstraction levels ensure efficiency and usability in complex systems.
