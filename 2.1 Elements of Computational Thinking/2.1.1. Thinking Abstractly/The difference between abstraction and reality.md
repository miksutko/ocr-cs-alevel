Abstraction is a simplified representation of reality. Real-world entities may be represented using computational structures such as tables and databases. Real-world values are often stored as variables. Object-oriented programming makes use of objects, which are also an abstraction for real-world entities. In object-oriented programming, abstraction considers the functionality, interface, and properties of entities. Attributes are an abstraction for the characteristics of an object, while methods are an abstraction for the actions a real-world object is able to perform.

# Devise an Abstract Model for a Variety of Situations
When devising an abstract model given a scenario, you must consider:
- **What is the problem that needs to be solved by the model?**  
    Can the problem be solved computationally? What are the key features of the problem?
- **How will the model be used?**  
    What sort of format does the model need to be displayed in? Consider factors such as convenience, affordability, and ease of access.
- **Who will the model be used by?**  
    How many people will be using the model? What level of expertise do they have in the subject/discipline associated with the problem?
- **Which parts of the problem are relevant based on the target audience and the purpose of the model?**  
    Remove sections that are not relevant to the problem that needs solving. Remove details that will confuse the audience.
