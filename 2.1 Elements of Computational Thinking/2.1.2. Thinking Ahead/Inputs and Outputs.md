Designing a solution entails thinking ahead about the different components of a problem and how they will be handled in the best way possible. Thinking ahead allows developers to consider problems or difficulties that may arise when the software is used. Taking these factors into account at an early stage, developers can design strategies to make programs easy and intuitive to use.
At their core, all computational problems consist of inputs which are processed to produce an output. Inputs include any data that is required to solve the problem, entered into the system by the user. Often, the order in which data is input and the method of input must also be taken into consideration. Outputs are the results that are passed back once the inputs have been processed and the problem solved. Designers must decide on a suitable data type, structure, and method to use in order to present the solution, given the scenario.

You must be able to identify the inputs and outputs that would be required to form a program given a scenario. Take, for example, a program designed for an ATM.
#### Inputs and Outputs for an ATM

|Inputs|Outputs|
|---|---|
|Transaction type: Deposit? Balance check? Withdrawal?|If deposit selected: Display total amount entered on screen|
|Card details, captured using a card reader|If balance check selected: Display total account balance on screen|
|PIN, entered via keypad|If withdrawal selected: Dispense correct amount of cash.|
||Print receipt to confirm transaction|
||Speaker provides verbal feedback throughput.|

You might also be asked about how this data is captured or relayed back to the user once processed. The input devices required would be a touch screen, magnetic stripe card reader, and keypad, while output devices would include a monitor, cash dispenser, printer, and speakers. Typically, designers begin by considering what outputs are required of the solution based on the userâ€™s requirements. The next step is to identify the inputs required and how these need to be processed to achieve these outputs.
