Commonly used functions are often packaged into libraries for reuse. Teams working on large projects that are likely to make use of certain components in multiple places might also choose to put together a library so these components can be reused. Reusable components include implementations of abstract data structures such as queues and stacks, as well as classes and subroutines. When designing a piece of software, the problem is decomposed: it is broken down into smaller, simpler tasks. This allows developers to think ahead about how each task can be solved and identify where program components developed in the past, or externally-sourced program components, can be reused to simplify the development process.

Reusable components are more reliable than newly coded components, as they have already been tested and any bugs dealt with. This saves time, money, and resources. Subroutines can then simply be reused with different arguments to produce a variety of outputs. Producing well-tested, reusable components means that they can also be reused in future projects, saving development costs. However, it may not always be possible to integrate existing components developed by third parties due to compatibility issues with the rest of the software. This may mean these components need to be modified to work with existing software, which can sometimes be more costly and time-consuming than developing them in-house.
