A crucial part of solving a problem is simplifying it to represent it in a way that makes it easier to understand and thus program. The following constructs are used to represent a programâ€™s control flow in a popular subsection of procedural programming called **structured programming**:
- **Sequence**  
    Code is executed line-by-line, from top to bottom.
- **Branching**  
    A certain block of code is run if a specific condition is met, using IF statements. This is also known as **selection**.
- **Iteration**  
    A block of code is executed a certain number of times or while a condition is met. Iteration uses **FOR**, **WHILE**, or **REPEAT UNTIL** loops. Iteration can be either:
    - **Count-controlled**  
        Iteration is repeated a given number of times.
```
        for i in range(0, 10):
		    print(i)
```
	- **Count-controlled**
        Iteration is repeated a given number of times.
```
        while i <= 20:
		    print("Not true")
		    i = i + 1
```
