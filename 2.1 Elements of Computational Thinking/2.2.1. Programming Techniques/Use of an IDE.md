An **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)** is a program that provides a set of tools to make it easier for programmers to write, develop, and debug code. Examples of IDEs include **PyCharm**, **Eclipse**, **IDLE**, and **Microsoft Visual Studio**. Common features of IDEs include:
- **Stepping**:  
    Allows you to monitor the effect of each individual line of code by executing a single line at a time.
- **Variable Watch**:  
    Sometimes used to pinpoint errors, this feature allows you to observe how the contents of a variable change in real-time through the execution of a program.
- **Breakpoint**:  
    IDEs allow users to set a point in the program at which it will stop. This can either be based on a condition or set to occur at a specific line, helping to pinpoint where an error is occurring.
- **Source Code Editor**:  
    The editor enhances the coding process by providing features such as autocompletion of words, indentation, syntax highlighting, and automatic bracket completion.
- **Debugging Tools**:  
    Some IDEs offer run-time detection of errors with guidance on where in the code they are likely to have occurred through line numbers and highlighting.
