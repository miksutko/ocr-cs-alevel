The techniques used in **object-oriented programming (OOP)** are fundamental throughout all of computer science. Object-oriented languages are built around the idea of **classes**. A class is a template for an **object** and defines the state and behaviour of that object.
- **State**:  
    Given by **attributes**, which describe an objectâ€™s properties.
- **Behaviour**:  
    Defined by the **methods** associated with a class, which describe the actions an object can perform.
Classes can be used to create objects through a process called **instantiation**. An object is a particular instance of a class, and a class can be used to create multiple objects with the same set of attributes and methods.
In OOP, attributes are declared as **private**, meaning they can only be altered by **public methods**. This is called **encapsulation**. Encapsulation is a technique used throughout programming to implement the principle of **information hiding**, making programs less complex by protecting data from being accidentally edited by other parts of the program. **Top-down design** implements the same principle of encapsulation, as each module is designed to be self-contained.
