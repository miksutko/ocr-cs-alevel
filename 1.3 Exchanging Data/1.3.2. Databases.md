# Relational Databases:
### 1. Key Concepts:
- **Entity** – An item of interest about which data is stored (e.g., Doctor, Patient).
- **Attribute** – A characteristic of an entity (e.g., Name, Age).
- **Relational Database** – A database that stores data in multiple tables, each representing an entity, with relationships between them.
- **Flat File** – A database with a single table, typically focused on one entity.
### 2. Keys in Databases:
- **Primary Key** – A unique identifier for each record in a table (e.g., PatientID).
- **Foreign Key** – An attribute that links two tables together, acting as a primary key in one table and a reference in another.
- **Secondary Key** – An attribute used for efficient searching (e.g., Surname).
### 3. Entity Relationship Modelling:
- **One-to-One (1:1)** – Each entity links to only one other entity (e.g., Husband-Wife).
- **One-to-Many (1:M)** – One entity can link to multiple entities (e.g., Mother-Children).
- **Many-to-Many (M:M)** – Multiple entities can be linked to multiple others (e.g., Students-Courses).
### 4. Normalisation:
- **1NF (First Normal Form)**:
	- Each column must contain **only a single value per row** (no multiple values in a single field).
	- Each row must be uniquely identifiable (using a **primary key**).
- **2NF (Second Normal Form)**:
	- The table must **already be in 1NF**.
	- **No partial dependencies**: Every non-key attribute must depend on the **entire** primary key, not just a part of it.
	- This is mostly relevant when using **composite primary keys** (a primary key consisting of multiple columns).
	- **Example with problem**:

| StudentID | Subject | StudentName | Grade |
| --------- | ------- | ----------- | ----- |
| 1         | Math    | John        | A     |
| 1         | English | John        | B     |
Here, the **key** is: StudentID + Subject (a composite key).  
**Problem**: `StudentName` only depends on `StudentID`, not on the whole key.  
So, move `StudentName` to its own table.

- **3NF (Third Normal Form)**:
	- The table must **already be in 2NF**.
	- **No transitive dependencies**: Non-key attributes must depend **only on the primary key**, not on another non-key attribute. M:M cannot be there`
	- **Example with problem**:

| StudentID | Subject | Teacher | Department |
| --------- | ------- | ------- | ---------- |
| 1         | Math    | Mr Lee  | Science    |
Here, `Department` depends on `Teacher`, not directly on `StudentID + Subject`.  
So, move Teacher + Department to their own table.
### 5. Indexing:
- Stores the position of records to speed up searches.
- The **primary key** is automatically indexed.
- **Secondary keys** are indexed to improve search speed.
### 6. Handling Data:
- **Capturing Data** – Input methods like manual entry, OCR, MICR, and OMR.
- **Selecting & Managing Data** – Filtering and structuring data, often using SQL.
- **Exchanging Data** – Transferring data electronically (e.g., EDI).
### 7. SQL (Structured Query Language):
- **SELECT** – Retrieves data.
- **FROM** – Specifies the table.
- **WHERE** – Filters results.
- **ORDER BY** – Sorts results (ascending by default, `DESC` for descending).
- **JOIN** – Combines data from multiple tables.
- **CREATE** – Defines a new table.
- **ALTER** – Modifies a table (add, delete, change columns).
- **INSERT INTO** – Adds records.
- **UPDATE** – Modifies existing records.
- **DELETE** – Removes records.
### 8. Referential Integrity:
- Ensures linked tables remain consistent (e.g., prevents deleting a doctor if patients are still linked).
### 9. Transaction Processing & ACID:
- **Atomicity** – Transactions must be fully completed or not at all.
- **Consistency** – Data must remain correct and follow the rules.
- **Isolation** – Transactions must run separately without affecting each other.
- **Durability** – Once a transaction is done, it must stay saved, even if the system fails.
### 10. Record Locking & Deadlocks:
- Prevents multiple users from editing the same record simultaneously.
- **Deadlock** occurs when two users wait for each other’s locked records, preventing progress.
### 11. Redundancy:
- Avoid record deadlocks by ensuring that transactions to not overlap in time. Two different techniques:
	- Timestamps ordering - each transaction with timestamp when initiated. In case of two transactions affect the same object, the earlier is first. Each object provided with read/write timestamp
	- Commitment ordering - the transactions are ordered using timestamps and dependent on each other. Transaction is blocked until another is completed. 
### 12. Redundancy:
- Keeping multiple copies of data to prevent loss in case of failure.
