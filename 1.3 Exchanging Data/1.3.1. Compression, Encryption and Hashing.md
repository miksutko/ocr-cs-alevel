# Compression:
Compression reduces file size to save storage and speed up file transfers. Itâ€™s useful for sharing files over networks.
- **Lossy Compression:** Reduces size by permanently removing data (e.g., lower image quality, missing audio frequencies).
	- JPEG Images: A high-resolution image (10MB) is compressed using JPEG lossy compression, reducing it to 2MB. The algorithm removes minor color variations and details that the human eye barely notices. Zooming in may show pixelation or blurriness, but for regular viewing, the quality remains acceptable.
	- MP3 Audio: A 320kbps MP3 file is compressed to 128kbps, reducing file size while removing inaudible frequencies. The lower-quality version sounds nearly identical unless listened to on high-end speakers.
- **Lossless Compression:** Shrinks file size without losing data, allowing full recovery.
	- PNG Images: A 5MB PNG file is compressed without losing detail. Unlike JPEG, PNG retains all pixel information, making it ideal for logos and graphics.
	- FLAC Audio: A WAV file (50MB) is compressed to FLAC (30MB) without any loss of quality. Every bit of the original sound is preserved, unlike MP3.
### Compression Methods:
- **Run-Length Encoding (RLE):** Replaces repeated values with a count (e.g., "AAAA" â†’ "A4").
	- Black-and-white images (Bitmap): Consider a 10-pixel-wide image row: ðŸ–¼ BBBBBBBBWW â†’ B8W2 Instead of storing "BBBBBBBBWW," RLE saves storage by counting repeating pixels. Works well for large areas of the same color but not detailed images.
- **Dictionary Encoding:** Replaces frequent phrases with shorter codes, requiring a dictionary for decompression.
	- **Text Compression (Speech Storage)**: Original speech text: _"We shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the land, we shall fight in the air."_. After dictionary encoding:	  
	 Compressed version: "1 2 3 beaches, 1 2 3 land, 1 2 4 air." - Saves space by replacing common phrases with numbers.

| Index | Phrase   |
| ----- | -------- |
| 1     | We shall |
| 2     | fight    |
| 3     | on the   |
| 4     | in the   |
# Encryption:
Encryption secures data during transmission by scrambling it.
- **Symmetric Encryption:** Uses a single private key for encryption and decryption, requiring secure key exchange.
	- Messaging Apps (AES Encryption): Alice wants to send Bob a secure message: "Meet me at 5 PM". The message is encrypted using the same secret key for encryption and decryption. If a hacker intercepts it, they see: "G@8L!z3K$#@" (Unreadable ciphertext) Only Bob (who has the key) can decrypt it.
- **Asymmetric Encryption:** Uses a public-private key pair. Public keys encrypt data, and only the private key can decrypt it. This also enables **digital signatures** to verify the senderâ€™s identity.
	- Email Encryption (PGP Encryption): Bob has a public key and a private key. Alice encrypts her email using Bobâ€™s public key. Only Bob can decrypt it with his private key. Example: Alice sends: "Secret meeting at 6 PM" Bob receives "JK$@f89!P&" Even if intercepted, the message stays secure. 
	- Digital Signatures: Bob signs a document using his private key. Anyone can verify authenticity using Bobâ€™s public key. Used for contracts, legal documents, and software verification.
# Hashing:
Hashing converts data into a fixed-length value (hash), which **cannot be reversed**.
- **Used for:**
    - Storing passwords securely
    - Fast lookups in hash tables (used in caches and databases)
- **Collisions:** Occur when two inputs produce the same hash. Good hash functions minimize this risk.
- **Example**: When signing up, a user enters: **Password: "Hello123"**. Instead of storing "Hello123," the system stores its **hash**: **5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99**. Even if hacked, attackers **cannot reverse** the hash to get "Hello123."
- **Storing Usernames in a Database**: Instead of searching a long list, a **hash function** stores data in a table: 

| Username | Hash (Index) |
| -------- | ------------ |
| Max123   | 2a3f67b8     |
| Alex567  | b9c8d123     |

- **Fast Search:** Instead of scanning 1,000,000 usernames, the system **jumps directly** to the correct index.
