# 1. Computers in the Workforce
## Opportunities:
- Increased efficiency (e.g., Amazon warehouse robots)
- Reduced labor costs → cheaper products
- Creation of new tech jobs (developers, engineers)
## Risks:
- Job displacement (manufacturing, service roles)
- Structural unemployment
- Over-reliance on systems (failure risks)
---
# 2. Automated Decision Making
## Applications:
- Social media algorithms
- Criminal risk assessments (US justice system)
- Financial lending/insurance
- Self-driving cars (ethical dilemmas)
### Key Issues:
- **Bias**: Algorithms reflect creator biases
- **Transparency**: "Black box" decision-making
- **Accountability**: Who's responsible for errors?

# 4. Environmental Effects
## Negative Impacts:
- E-waste (toxic components)
- Energy consumption → climate change
- Planned obsolescence culture
## Positive Solutions:
- Smart energy systems
- Renewable energy adoption
- Recycling programs
