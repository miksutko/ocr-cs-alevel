# Time Complexity (Big-O Notation)

![[Pasted image 20260209095727.png]]
Time Complexity: This measures how the execution time (the number of computational steps) of an algorithm scales as the input size grows
Space Complexity: This measures the total memory usage required by an algorithm to run to completion as a function of the input size.

**Positives**:
- Provides a **clear upper bound** on algorithm performance.    
- Allows comparison of algorithms **independent of hardware**.
- Focuses on **scalability** as input size increases.
- Helps predict behaviour for **large datasets**.
- Encourages efficient algorithm design.
**Negatives**:
- Describes **worst-case scenario only** (usually).
- Ignores constant factors (e.g. 2n vs n).
- Doesn’t show actual execution time.
- Doesn’t reflect small input performance accurately.
- Assumes large input sizes (asymptotic behaviour).

| -------------- | ------------ | ------------------- | ----------------- |
| **O(1)**       | Constant     | Array index access  | Flat line         |
| **O(log n)**   | Logarithmic  | Binary search       | Shallow curve     |
| **O(n)**       | Linear       | Simple loop         | Straight diagonal |
| **O(n log n)** | Linearithmic | Merge sort          | Curved steepening |
| **O(n²)**      | Quadratic    | Nested loops        | Parabola          |
