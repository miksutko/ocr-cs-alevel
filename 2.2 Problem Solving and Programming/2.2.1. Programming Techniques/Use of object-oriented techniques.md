- **Class**: blueprint that defines an object’s attributes (data) and methods (operations).
- **Object**: an instance of a class (created by **instantiation**).
- **Constructor**: sets up initial attribute values when an object is created.
- **Encapsulation**: data is accessed/changed via methods (often using get/set style methods).
- More advanced OO programs also use **inheritance** and **polymorphism**.
