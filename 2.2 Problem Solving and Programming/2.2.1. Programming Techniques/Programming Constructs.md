# Sequence
- **Sequence** means instructions run **once each**, in the **order written** (top to bottom).
# Branching (Selection)
Branching is used when the program must **choose** what to do next based on a condition.
  
Common forms:
- **IF**: run a block only if a condition is true.
- **IF … ELSE**: one block runs if true, the other runs if false.
- **IF … ELIF … ELSE**: check multiple conditions in order; the first true block runs.
- **SELECT CASE / switch-case** (not in every language): selects an outcome based on a single variable’s value; often includes a **default/CASE ELSE**.
# Iteration (Loops)
Iteration repeats instructions:
- **Count-controlled**: repeat a set number of times (typically **FOR** loops).
- **Condition-controlled**: repeat until a condition is met (typically **WHILE** loops).
# Nesting
- **Nesting** = placing one construct inside another (e.g., an IF inside a WHILE loop, or a loop inside an IF). This is common in real programs.
