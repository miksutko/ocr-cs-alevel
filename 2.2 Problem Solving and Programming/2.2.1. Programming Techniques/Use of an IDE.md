An IDE is a set of tools to help you write and debug code. Common features include:
- Syntax highlighting, line numbering, help pop-ups, and showing matching constructs (e.g., matching IF/ELSE).
- **Automatic error checking**: flags issues before running where possible.
- **Error reports**: lists errors that must be fixed before execution.
- **Breakpoints**: pause execution at a chosen line to inspect variable values.
- **Stepping through**: execute code one instruction at a time to see exactly when values change.    
- **Runtime error identification**: can stop during execution, highlight the line, and suggest fixes.

**IDE vs Notepad (exam-friendly comparison):**
- A basic text editor (like Notepad) can write code, but it usually **doesn’t provide integrated debugging** (breakpoints/stepping), **doesn’t automatically check errors**, and gives less support for readability (syntax highlighting/line tools). IDEs include these tools, so debugging is faster and mistakes are easier to spot.
