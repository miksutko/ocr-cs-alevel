### **What is a Character Set?**
A **character set** is a collection of codes and corresponding characters used by computers to represent text. Character sets enable computers to interpret and display textual information consistently.

### **ðŸ“Œ 1. ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange)**
- **Overview:** ASCII was the primary character set before the development of Unicode.
- **Bit Size:** Uses **7 bits**, allowing for 27=1282^7 = 12827=128 different characters.

#### **Character Representation:**
- **Uppercase Letters:** A-Z (codes 65-90)
- **Lowercase Letters:** a-z (codes 97-122)
- **Digits:** 0-9 (codes 48-57)
- **Special Symbols:** Various symbols (e.g., punctuation marks)

#### **Limitations:**
- The 128-character limit restricts representation to standard letters, numbers, and symbols.
- **Challenge:** ASCII cannot represent characters from other languages, leading to limitations in global computing.

### **ðŸ“Œ 2. Unicode**
- **Overview:** Unicode was developed to address the limitations of ASCII and provide a comprehensive character set for global use.
- **Bit Size:** Uses a variable number of bits, typically **16 bits** or **32 bits**, allowing for over **1 million** different characters.
#### **Key Features:**
- **Multilingual Support:** Unicode can represent characters from a wide range of languages, including:
    - Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, and more.
- **Symbols and Emoji:** Unicode includes a vast array of symbols, mathematical characters, and emojis.
- **Encoding Forms:** Unicode can be encoded in various formats such as UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32, which determine how characters are stored in memory.
