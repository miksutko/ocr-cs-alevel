**Definition:**  
An array is an ordered set of elements, all of the same type.
**Key Characteristics:**
- Elements are indexed, usually starting from 0 (zero-indexed).
- Arrays can have one or more dimensions.

### **Types of Arrays**
**1. One-Dimensional (1D) Array**
- A linear arrangement of elements.
- Example: An array `[1, 23, 12, 14, 16, 29, 12]`.
- To access the 4th element (index 3), use `oneDimensionalArray[3]`, which gives `14`.
**2. Two-Dimensional (2D) Array**
- Visualized as a table with rows and columns.
- Example: A 2D array has rows like `[[123, 28, 90, 38], [1, 23, 12, 14]]`.
- To access the element in the second row, fourth column (index [1, 3]), use `twoDimensionalArray[1,3]`, which gives `14`.
**3. Three-Dimensional (3D) Array**
- Visualized as multiple 2D arrays stacked together (like layers).
- Example: A 3D array has layers like `[[[12, 8], [9, 6, 19]], [[241, 89, 4, 1], [19, 2]]]`.
- To access an element in the first layer, second row, third column (index [0, 1, 2]), use `threeDimensionalArray[0,1,2]`, which gives `19`.

### **Key Points to Remember**
1. **Indexing Order:**
    - For 2D arrays: First row, then column.
    - For 3D arrays: First layer, then row, then column.
2. **Dimensional Visualizations:**
    - 1D: A single list of elements.
    - 2D: A table with rows and columns.
    - 3D: Multiple tables stacked together.
3. **Usage:**
    - Arrays are useful for organizing and accessing data in an ordered way.
