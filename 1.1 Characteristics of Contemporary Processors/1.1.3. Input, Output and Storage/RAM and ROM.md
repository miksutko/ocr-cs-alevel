# RAM (Random Access Memory):
- **Description**: larger, volatile and editable storage that temporarily holds instruction and data. It operates at a much faster speed than most secondary storage devices.
- **Key Characteristics**:
    - **Fast**: Faster than secondary storage.
    - **Volatile**: Loses data when power is turned off.
    - **Capacity**: Typically 8GBâ€“16GB in most systems, much smaller than secondary storage.
    - **Usage**: Enhances speed and performance during program execution.
# ROM (Read-Only Memory):
- **Description**: small read-only memory located on the motherboard (it cannot be altered so there is no chance of the OS being accidently or maliciously changed). It is non-volatile, containing the very first bootstrap instructions for the computer and is quick to start up.
- **Key Characteristics**:
    - **Non-Volatile**: Retains data even when powered off.
    - **Unmodifiable**: Contents are programmed once and cannot be altered.
    - **Usage**: Essential for fixed, critical instructions needed for system boot-up.
