# 1. Optical Storage:
- **Examples**: CDs, DVDs, Blu-Ray.
- **Mechanism**: Data stored as pits (0) and lands (1), read using laser light.
- **Key Points**:
    - **CD**: Small capacity (up to 700MB), portable, used for audio and images.
    - **DVD**: Higher capacity (4.7GB-17GB), suited for videos.
    - **Blu-Ray**: Very high capacity (up to 128GB), ideal for HD content.
- **Advantages**: Cheap, lightweight, portable.
- **Disadvantages**: Prone to scratches, slower transfer speeds, limited storage.
# 2. Magnetic Storage:
- **Examples**: HDDs, Magnetic Tape, Floppy Disks.
- **Mechanism**: Binary data stored as polarised (1) or unpolarised (0) magnetic regions.
- **HDDs**:
	- Work by magnetic patterns being read off platters that mechanically spin at high speeds.
    - Large capacity (500GB to 5TB).
- **Magnetic Tape**:
    - Used historically for data storage; now outdated.
    - Bulky, slow access.
- **Floppy Disks**:
    - Portable but low capacity (1MB). Outdated for modern needs.
- **Advantages**: Cheaper per GB, tend to have much higher capacities than flash hard drives
- **Disadvantages**: Slower speeds, fragile due to moving parts.
# 3. Flash Storage:
- **Examples**: SSDs, USB Drives, Memory Cards.
- **Mechanism**: Binary data stored using NAND/NOR gates, representing high (1) and low (0) electrical states.
- **SSDs**:
	- Work by using memory chips. There can have their contents erased and subsequently overwritten when an electrical charge is applied.
- **Advantages**: Fast, portable, durable (no moving parts), and non-volatile.
- **Disadvantages**: Expensive per GB, limited lifespan due to wear from repeated writes.

# Virtual Storage (Cloud Storage):
- **Description**: Virtual storage allows information to be stored remotely and accessed from any device with internet access. Examples include cloud services like Google Drive and OneDrive, as well as networked storage in offices and schools.
- **Advantages**:
1. Accessible anywhere, anytime with internet.
2. Easy file sharing and collaboration.
- **Disadvantages**:
1. Dependent on network speed and connection stability.
2. Can be expensive to maintain or use.
