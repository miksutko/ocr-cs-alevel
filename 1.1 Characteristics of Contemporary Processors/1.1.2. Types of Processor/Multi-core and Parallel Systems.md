Modern computers typically have **multicore CPUs** and often include parallel processing capabilities.
1. **Multi-Core CPUs**:
    - CPUs with multiple **independent cores**, each capable of executing instructions simultaneously.
    - **Benefit**: Higher performance for complex tasks like video editing or running multiple programs.
    **Example**:
    - A quad-core processor can handle four tasks simultaneously, such as rendering a video, running a browser, and gaming.
2. **Parallel Systems**:
    - Multiple processors in the same computer.
    - Use **threading** within a single core to handle tasks as if running simultaneously.
    - **Benefit**: Efficient for simpler repetitive tasks where dividing cores isnâ€™t necessary.
    **Example**:
    - A single-core processor with parallel threads processing multiple web requests on a server.
    **Don't mix up with**:
	- **Pipelining** can be thought of as an assembly line where each worker (stage) performs a specific task on different products (instructions) at the same time.
	- **Parallel systems** can be likened to multiple assembly lines running simultaneously, each handling different products (tasks) concurrently.
# Graphics Processing Unit (GPU):
- **Purpose**:
    - Designed for **parallel processing**, making it ideal for repetitive, computation-heavy tasks like **graphics rendering**, **image processing**, or **machine learning**.
    - Works as a **co-processor** to assist the CPU.
- **How It Works**:
    - Unlike a CPU with a few cores, GPUs have thousands of smaller processors working together.
    - This makes them highly effective for tasks that can be broken down into smaller operations performed simultaneously.
### **Key Difference**

|**Aspect**|**Multi-Core Systems**|**Parallel Systems**|**GPU**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Task Handling**|Multiple cores execute tasks|Threads within a single core|Thousands of processors handle tasks|
|**Ideal For**|Large projects (e.g., video editing)|Repetitive, lightweight tasks|Graphics rendering, AI, image processing|
|**Hardware**|Requires multiple CPU cores|Uses one core with threading|Specialized for parallel processing|
