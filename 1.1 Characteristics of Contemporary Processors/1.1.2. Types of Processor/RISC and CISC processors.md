| Reduced Instruction Set Computers (RISC) ARM                                              | Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISC) x86                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Fewer bits allocated to the operation code, so uses a small instruction set, less complex | More bits allocated to operation code, so uses a large instruction set, more complex |
| Each instruction takes **one clock cycle** to execute.                                    | Each instruction can accomplish **complex tasks** in fewer lines of code.            |
| Instructions are simple and written as single lines of machine code.                      | Many instructions are built into the hardware, even if theyâ€™re rarely used.          |
| **Advantages and Disadvantages**                                                          |                                                                                      |
| Requires more RAM since code is longer.                                                   | Shorter code, so less RAM is required.                                               |
| Ideal for performance-critical tasks like gaming or multimedia applications.              | The compiler has less work to translate high-level code into machine code.           |
| Pipelining is efficient because all instructions are uniform in execution time.           | Pipelining is less efficient since instructions vary in execution time.              |
| More transistors used for memory registers                                                | More transistors used for storing complex instructions                               |
| Assembly language programmers have more work to do.                                       | Easier for assembly language programmers.                                            |
