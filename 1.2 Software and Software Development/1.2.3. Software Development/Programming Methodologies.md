 Software development methodologies define the process and structure for planning, designing, developing, and maintaining software. Each methodology has its own strengths and weaknesses and is suited to specific types of projects. Below is a summary of the key methodologies and their characteristics:
# Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
**Stages of SDLC**:
1. **Analysis**:
    - Stakeholder requirements are gathered to define the systemâ€™s needs.
    - Strengths and weaknesses of the current solution are analyzed.
2. **Design**:
    - Inputs, outputs, security, hardware, and the user interface are designed.
    - A test plan is also prepared.
3. **Development**:
    - The system is broken into modules for programming by teams.
4. **Testing**:
    - Different testing methods ensure functionality:
	    - **Alpha Testing**: Performed by the development team to fix initial bugs.
	    - **Beta Testing**: Conducted by end-users for feedback.
	    - **White Box Testing**: Tests internal program structure. Dry source code runs. Trace tables. Checking every possible condition if they are right.
	    - **Black Box Testing**: Tests inputs and outputs without knowing the internal structure.
5. **Implementation**:
	- The software is installed in the user environment.
6. **Evaluation**:
    - The system is evaluated for robustness, reliability, portability, and maintainability.
7. **Maintenance**:
    - Updates are made to address bugs, improve performance, or fix security issues.
# 1. Waterfall Model:
- **Description**: A traditional, sequential approach where each stage must be completed before the next begins.
- **Key Features**:
    - Stages include analysis, design, development, testing, implementation, and evaluation.
    - User involvement is limited to the analysis and evaluation stages.
- **Advantages**:
    - Simple and structured.
    - Works well for small, well-defined projects.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Inflexible to changes; any modifications require revisiting all prior stages.
    - Limited user feedback during development.
# 2. Agile Methodologies:
- **Description**: A flexible approach where development is iterative and sections of the system are developed in parallel.
- **Key Features**:
    - Prototypes are delivered and improved iteratively.
    - Prioritizes user satisfaction and fast adaptability to changing requirements.
    - Reduces focus on documentation.
- **Advantages**:
    - Faster delivery of functional software.
    - Encourages frequent user feedback and adaptability.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Less formal documentation may lead to difficulties in maintenance.
    - May be challenging for teams not familiar with agile principles.
# 3. Extreme Programming (XP):
- **Description**: An agile model emphasizing collaboration between programmers and end-users.
- **Key Features**:
    - End-users specify system requirements through "user stories."
    - Pair programming ensures high-quality code.
    - Focus on maintaining a sustainable workload (40 hours per week).
- **Advantages**:
    - Produces reliable and high-quality code.
    - Frequent end-user input ensures the system meets user needs.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Limited documentation.
    - May not be suited for projects requiring extensive long-term records.
# 4. Spiral Model:
- **Description**: A risk-focused model that emphasizes iteration and evaluation.
- **Key Features**:
    - Four stages: requirement analysis, risk mitigation, development and testing, and evaluation.
    - Iterative process continues until the system is complete.
- **Advantages**:
    - Effective for risk-heavy and large-scale projects.
    - Allows for early identification of risks.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Expensive due to the need for risk assessors.
    - Complex and not suited for small projects.
# 5. Rapid Application Development (RAD):
- **Description**: A methodology that emphasizes quick development using prototypes.
- **Key Features**:
    - User feedback drives iterative improvement of prototypes.
    - Focus groups gather user requirements initially.
    - Continual refinement leads to the final product.
- **Advantages**:
    - Ideal for projects with unclear initial requirements.
    - Accelerates delivery of functional prototypes.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - Frequent changes can lead to inefficient code.
    - May require skilled developers familiar with the iterative approach.
### Summary of Methodologies:

| Method                       | Core Idea                              | Best For               | **Drawbacks**                          |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Waterfall**                | Step-by-step stages (linear)           | Small, stable projects | Inflexible to changes                  |
| **Agile**                    | Iterative, fast, user-focused          | Changing needs         | Less formal documentation              |
| **Extreme Programming (XP)** | Agile + strict teamwork & code quality | Collaborative coding   | Limited documentation                  |
| **Spiral**                   | Iterative + risk evaluation            | Big, risky projects    | Expensive and complex                  |
| **RAD**                      | Quick prototypes + user feedback       | Unclear requirements   | Inefficient code from frequent changes |
