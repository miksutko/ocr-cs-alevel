- **Description**: A virtual machine is a **software-based emulation** of a computer system, allowing programs to run in a simulated environment rather than directly on physical hardware.
# Key Features:
- **Environment Simulation**: Provides a virtualized environment to execute software or intermediate code.
- **Intermediate Code Execution**:
    - **Definition**: Code that is between high-level and machine code, designed to be processor-independent.
    - **Advantage**: Ensures compatibility across different devices and operating systems.
# Uses of Virtual Machines:
1. **Development and Testing**:
    - VMs allow programmers to test software across different OS platforms without requiring multiple devices.
    - Cost and time-effective solution for software development.
2. **Protection from Malware**:
    - Malware executed within a VM affects only the virtual environment, keeping the host device safe.
3. **Running Incompatible Software**:
    - Enables the use of software designed for other operating systems or hardware.
    - Example: Running console games on a PC through emulated virtual machines.
# Advantages:
- Saves hardware costs by simulating different operating systems on a single device.
- Enables safe environments for testing potentially harmful or untrusted software.
- Facilitates cross-platform software development.
# Disadvantages:
- **Performance**: Running code in a VM is slower than executing native code directly on hardware.
- **Resource-Intensive**: Requires substantial memory and processing power to run multiple virtualized environments simultaneously.
