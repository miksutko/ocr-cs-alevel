**Definition**: Interrupts are signals generated by hardware or software to alert the processor that an event requires immediate attention. They allow the CPU to respond to external events and manage multiple processes effectively by prioritizing tasks.
# Types of Interrupts:
Interrupts can be categorized based on their origin and urgency:
1. **Hardware Interrupts**: Generated by hardware devices (e.g., keyboard, mouse, printer) to indicate that an event has occurred (e.g., a key press or a completed print job).
2. **Software Interrupts**: Initiated by programs to signal that a specific condition has occurred or to request system services (e.g., exceptions or system calls).
# Interrupt Priority and Management:
- **Priority Levels**: Each interrupt has a priority level that determines its urgency. The operating system must consider these priorities when allocating processor time.
- **Interrupt Register**: Interrupts are stored in a priority queue within an **interrupt register**. The operating system manages this queue to ensure that higher-priority interrupts are serviced first.
# Interrupt Service Routine (ISR):
**Definition**: The Interrupt Service Routine is a special function that the processor executes in response to an interrupt.
### Process of Servicing an Interrupt
1. **End of Cycle Check**: At the end of each Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle, the processor checks the interrupt register for any pending interrupts.
2. **Context Saving**: If a higher-priority interrupt is detected, the current contents of the CPU's registers are saved onto a stack to preserve the state of the currently running process.
3. **Loading the ISR**: The PC is then loads the appropriate ISR to handle the interrupt. *A flag is set to indicate that the ISR is currently being executed.*
4. **Servicing the Interrupt**: The ISR executes the necessary actions to address the interrupt (e.g., processing data from a hardware device).
5. ***Flag Reset**: Once the ISR has completed its task, the flag is reset to signal that the ISR is finished.*
6. ***Queue Check**: The interrupt queue is checked for any additional higher-priority interrupts. If any exist, the process repeats from the context-saving step.*
7. **Resuming Execution**: If there are no more high-priority interrupts, the contents of the stack are restored to the CPU registers, and the processor resumes the original Fetch-Decode-Execute cycle.
