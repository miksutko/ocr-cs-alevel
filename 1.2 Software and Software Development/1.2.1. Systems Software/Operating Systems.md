- **Description**: a collection of programs that acts as an interface between the user and the computer, managing hardware, software, and system resources.
# Key Functions:
- **Memory Management**: Paging, segmentation, and virtual memory.
- **Resource Management**: Scheduling tasks efficiently.
- **File Management**: Organizing, editing, and deleting files/folders.
- **I/O Management**: Using device drivers to control peripherals.
- **Interrupt Handling**: Responding to hardware and software interrupts.
- **Utility Software**: Tools like disk defragmentation, backups, and formatting.
- **Security**: Firewall and other protective measures.
- **User Interface**: Interaction via graphical (GUI) or command-line interfaces.

# Types of Operating Systems:

1. **Distributed OS**
    - Runs across multiple devices, sharing processing loads.
    - Example: Cloud computing systems.
    - A type of parallel processing, spreads the load over several servers for high performance
2. **Embedded OS**
    - Designed for specific devices with limited functionality.
    - Low power consumption; hard to update.
    - Example: Smart appliances and IoT devices.
3. **Multi-tasking OS**
    - Allows simultaneous tasks by switching quickly between them (time slicing).
    - Example: Windows and macOS.
4. **Multi-user OS**
    - Supports multiple users on a single computer, often in supercomputers.
    - Requires scheduling to prevent processor starvation.
5. **Real-time OS**
    - Performs tasks within guaranteed time limits, crucial for safety-critical systems.
    - Example: Self-driving cars, nuclear reactor controls.
