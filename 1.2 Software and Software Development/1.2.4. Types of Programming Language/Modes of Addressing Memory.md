Memory addressing modes specify how the operand of a machine code instruction should be interpreted. By leveraging different addressing modes, a program can flexibly access and manipulate memory locations.
# Structure of Machine Code Instruction:
1. **Opcode**: Defines the operation to be performed (e.g., `ADD`, `SUB`).
2. **Operand**: Specifies the value or location of the value for the operation.
# Addressing Modes:
1. **Immediate Addressing**
    - The operand is the actual value to be used in the operation.
    - Simplest form of addressing since the value is directly embedded in the instruction.
    - Example:
	    `ADD 5`
	    (Add 5 to the Accumulator)
2. **Direct Addressing**
	- The operand specifies the **memory address** where the required data is stored.
	- Used in **Little Man Computer (LMC)** and other basic systems.
	- Example:
		`LDA 15`
		(Load the value stored at memory address 15 into the Accumulator)
3. **Indirect Addressing**
	- The operand specifies a **memory address of a register**, which in turn holds another memory address where the actual data is stored.
	- Useful for dynamic memory management and implementing pointers.
	- Example:
		`LDA 20`
		(Load the value from the address stored at memory location 20)
4. **Indexed Addressing**
	- Combines a **base address** (given by the operand) with an **offset** stored in an index register.
	- Commonly used for accessing data in arrays or contiguous memory.
	- Example:
		`LDA 10(x)`
		(Load the value at the address calculated by `10 + X`, where `X` is the index register value)
# Comparison of Addressing Modes:

| **Addressing Mode**  | **Operand Represents**              | **Use Case**                                       |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Immediate Addressing | The actual data value               | Simple operations like adding constants.           |
| Direct Addressing    | Address of the data                 | Accessing fixed memory locations, e.g., variables. |
| Indirect Addressing  | Address of a register with the data | Dynamic data access, implementing pointers.        |
| Indexed Addressing   | Base address + index offset         | Array processing, sequential data access.          |

# Example Program in LMC Using Direct Addressing:
`INP          // Input a value into the Accumulator`
`STA num      // Store the value at address 'num'`
`LDA num      // Load the value at address 'num'`
`ADD 5        // Add 5 to the value in the Accumulator`
`OUT          // Output the result`
`HLT          // Halt the program`
`num DAT      // Reserve a memory location for 'num'`
# Advantages of Addressing Modes:
- **Efficiency**: Allows quick access to data and reduces the complexity of instructions.
- **Flexibility**: Enables dynamic programming techniques like looping and array manipulation.
- **Versatility**: Supports a wide range of operations by interpreting operands differently.
# Disadvantages:
- **Complexity**: More advanced modes like indirect or indexed addressing can be harder to implement and understand.
- **Processor-Specific**: Addressing modes vary between different CPU architectures, making portability difficult.
